&#128075; Hi there, my name is Kodie Grantham.

I'm the Lead Engineer/Systems Administrator at [Happy Medium](https://itsahappymedium.com) and am currently residing in Pleasant Hill, Iowa.

I'm also the father to two badass kids. I'm an enthusiast of music, technology, and anything mechanical. I enjoy riding motorcycles, working in my garage, video games, traveling, concerts/shows/festivals, skateboarding, BMX, movies, anime, food, drinks, and of course, coding.

I started coding back in 1999 when I was only 10 years old. I would make websites for gaming clubs using Yahoo Geocities which was basically a drag-and-drop website builder, but it also allowed you to modify the code directly which is where I started my tinkering. Eventually I would discover PHP and took off from there.

I program in a few different languages and use a few different technologies but my favorites and the ones I have the most experience in are JavaScript (Node/React) and PHP. I love open source and developing new tools/frameworks that make the developer life just a little easier.

So have a look around, check out some of my projects, and feel free to reach out for anything.
